## 🎨 Established Brand Guidelines

### **Color Palette (Implemented)**
| Purpose | Hex Code | Tailwind Class | Usage |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Primary Brand | `#216869` | `bg-wcn-primary` | Step numbers, core UI elements |

| Accent 2 | `#9cc5a1` | `bg-wcn-accent2` | Testimonials, secondary elements |
| Text | `#dce1de` | `text-wcn-text` | Primary text, high contrast |
| Dark | `#000000` | `bg-wcn-dark` | Backgrounds, emphasis |

### **Visual Identity Principles**
- **Typography:** Clean, bold sans-serif (currently using system fonts)
- **Layout:** Grid systems with generous whitespace
- **Components:** Modular, minimal, fast-loading
- **Effects:** Frosted glass cards (`bg-wcn-card` + `backdrop-blur-sm`)
- **Animation:** Subtle transitions for clarity, not flashiness

### **Brand Voice**
- **Honest:** Direct communication, no corporate speak
- **Relatable:** Coach-like tone, not corporate

## 🎯 Design Brief Summary

**Transform the WCN platform's aesthetic to better express its core values of human-centered, privacy-first coaching while maintaining the functional, no-BS approach that defines the brand.**

The platform currently works well functionally but has opportunities for visual refinement that would:
1. Better communicate trust and expertise
2. Enhance the human coaching emphasis
3. Improve visual hierarchy and user guidance
4. Strengthen brand identity expression

**Goal:** Evolve from "functional but basic" to "professional and trustworthy" while preserving the authentic, unpolished brand character that makes WCN distinctive in the coaching space.
