**Subject:** Introducing _The Catalyst_ — A Human-Centered Platform for Sustainable Behavior Change

To Whom It May Concern,

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about [_What Comes Next, LLC_](/about) and our flagship product, [_The Catalyst_](/promo). I’m Jason Rashaad — a Builder by trade, a Founder by necessity, and a Rebuilder by force of will. After experiencing firsthand the emotional and logistical failures of modern fitness tools during my own health crisis, I committed to building a better system — one that values trust, human agency, and long-term change over superficial engagement.

_The Catalyst_ is a privacy-first behavior change platform designed specifically for personal trainers and their clients. Unlike generic fitness apps or bloated SaaS tools, our product ecosystem supports real human coaching, not just content delivery. It includes:

- **[The Spark](https://whatcomesnextllc.ai/the-spark)** – A free habit-tracking mobile app that empowers users to log workouts and meals offline, building momentum one “Spark” at a time.

- **[Coach’s Clipboard](https://whatcomesnextllc.ai/admin)** – A lightweight CRM for trainers to view client progress, assign nudges, and extend support beyond gym walls.

- **Day in the Life Plans** – AI-generated behavioral blueprints tailored to individual goals, available direct-to-consumer or through coach resale.

This isn’t a whitepaper or a wishlist — we’ve already built a working beta with zero outside capital. All development to date was self-funded (including, yes, selling my own car), and we are now piloting with early users while preparing to scale regionally.

What follows [in our full investor memo](https://whatcomesnextllc.ai/investors) is a detailed breakdown of our market opportunity, product architecture, GTM strategy, early traction, and our $250K seed raise to fund the next 18 months of growth. We’ve grounded this work in research, validated it with real-world interviews, and built every feature with empathy for both trainer and client in mind.

We are seeking investor partners who share our belief that the future of fitness will be powered not just by AI, but by _accountability, access, and trust_.

If this speaks to you — as a trainer, a potential user, or a backer — I invite you to join us. What comes next is already in motion.

Warmly,  
**Jason Rashaad**  
Founder & CEO
